#### How to Achieve: Not Seeking Others' Approval

1. Self-reflection and Awareness

   - Why do I care about others' opinions?
   - What makes me feel uneasy, insecure?
   - What are the roots of these thoughts?

2. Developing Self-awareness and Confidence

   - Set personal goals: What do I truly want to achieve, not just to please others?
   - Record achievements: To boost confidence
   - Positive self-talk: Remind yourself of your value and strengths, avoid negative self-evaluation

3. Establishing Healthy Interpersonal Relationships

   - Choose a positive social circle: Interact with people who support you
   - Set boundaries: Clearly say “no”, do not sacrifice yourself to satisfy others beyond these boundaries

4. Training Independent Thinking

   - Develop a critical spirit: Think independently, analyze issues, rather than simply accepting others' opinions
   - Maintain independent decision-making: Rely more on your own judgment when making decisions, rather than others' opinions

5. Self-motivation

   - Find internal drive and motivation, rather than external rewards or approval

6. Practice Meditation and Mindfulness

   - Meditation: Spend some time each day meditating, focus attention, reduce sensitivity to external judgments
   - Mindfulness: Practice mindfulness, focus on the present, reduce worries

#### Meditation

1. Choose a quiet environment

2. Set a time limit: Start from 5-10 minutes, gradually increase to 20-30 minutes

3. A comfortable posture

4. Focus on breathing:

   - Concentrate on your breath, feel each inhalation and exhalation
   - Mentally note “inhale” and “exhale” to help focus your attention

5. Notice your thoughts

   - When you notice your thoughts, do not judge, just notice their presence and gently bring your attention back to your breath
   - Repeat this process, do not be discouraged by distractions

6. Ending the meditation

   - After the set time, slowly open your eyes, spend a minute or two feeling your state, and gradually come out of meditation

#### Mindfulness
Focusing on the present experience to reduce worries about the past and future.

1. Choose a routine activity: Showering, eating, walking, etc.

2. Fully engage in the activity

   - Concentrate all your attention on this activity, feel every detail
     For example, while eating, notice the taste, texture, and smell of the food, savor each bite

3. Observe without judgment

   - Observe your sensations, but do not judge them

4. Use all five senses

   - Try to fully utilize your five senses to experience the present
     For example, while walking, feel the contact with the ground, listen to the sounds around you, see the scenery along the way, smell the air

5. Regular practice
   Spend a few minutes each day on mindfulness practice, which can be done anytime in daily life
