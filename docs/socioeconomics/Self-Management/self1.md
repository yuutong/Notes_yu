I previously worked at Shenzhen Sejong Automation for two years,<br>
primarily focusing on 3C electronics visual inspection projects. <br>
The core of these projects was utilizing cameras to capture images, <br>
which were then processed by a vision system to achieve precise positioning,<br>
 identification, inspection, and measurement of components.

This is a streamlined process where a robot moves the components to specific positions, <br>
the camera scans the object contours, and 3D point cloud data is acquired. <br>
The data is further processed to detect contours, edges, and corners, enabling positioning,<br>
contamination detection, and height measurement. <br>
Ultimately, this process is applied to automate product dispensing and placement. <br>
The camera (including light source and lens) and vision system function like the eyes and brain of the robot, respectively. 

Machine vision replaces human eyes and brains with cameras and vision systems to perform recognition,<br>
inspection, and judgment tasks. <br>
I was an early member of the project team, initially responsible for the design of the inspection software architecture. <br>
Inspired by the open-source project CloudCompare, I designed and built a plugin-based software framework.<br>

As the team expanded, I had the opportunity to participate in the development of image processing modules. <br>
Later, I continued working in image processing at Zhuhai Pantum Electronics' Shenzhen branch, <br>
focusing on image compression and content recognition.
