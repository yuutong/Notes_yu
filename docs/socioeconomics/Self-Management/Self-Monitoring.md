1.Talking to oneself when facing difficulties in doing things

2.Habitually saying "I made a mistake, I'm sorry" when feeling nervous or anxious



#### correction

Take a deep breath when facing difficulties, keep quiet, do not sigh, do not complain

Do not mumble (in any situation)

Take a deep breath when feeling nervous or anxious, force yourself to think, and organize your thoughts
