**Self-Introduction:**

I have a solid background in camera image quality engineering, with two years of experience at Shenzhen Sejong Automation, focusing on 3C electronics visual inspection projects. My role primarily involved utilizing cameras to capture images, processed by a vision system to achieve precise positioning, identification, inspection, and measurement of components.

**Project Experience:**

At Shenzhen Sejong Automation, I played a key role in 3C electronics visual inspection projects. The core of these projects was leveraging cameras to capture images, which were then processed by a vision system for precise positioning, identification, inspection, and measurement of components. This streamlined process involved robots moving components to specific positions, cameras scanning object contours, and acquiring 3D point cloud data. This data was further processed to detect contours, edges, and corners, enabling positioning, contamination detection, and height measurement, ultimately applied to automate product dispensing and placement. The camera and vision system functioned like the eyes and brain of the robot, respectively, replacing human eyes and brains with technology for recognition, inspection, and judgment tasks.

I was an early member of the project team, initially responsible for designing the inspection software architecture. Inspired by the open-source project CloudCompare, I designed and built a plugin-based software framework. As the team expanded, I had the opportunity to participate in the development of image processing modules.

Later, at Zhuhai Pantum Electronics' Shenzhen branch, I continued working in image processing, focusing on image compression and content recognition.
